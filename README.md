## Project Overview
### To review weather patterns in Hawaii as we look to open a surf and ice cream shop. This project concentrated on the weather temperature in June and December, looking at different statistics between the two terms to help assess whether an ice cream/surf shop would have great weather situations in which to operate.

## Results
### June temperature statistics

### Decembers temperature statistics

### These two tables tell us about the different weather patterns for the two monthly periods. Some takeaways:
From an average standpoint, the average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees, respectively, showing a moderate temperature and minimal fluctuation between the two periods.
The highest temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also remarkably similar.
The smallest temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the most significant variance and reflect a much lower temperature in December that may not be helpful to ice cream or surfing. However, with regular deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December), we would require a little more variation in the December numbers.

## Summary
### Overall the weather in December and June are historically very similar. However, December has a broader range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's.
Additional queries that could be run include Precipitation difference between June and December to determine if one has more rainy weather and comparison by the weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be essentially interested in the weather station closest to our prospective site, narrowing the results and providing the best data to consider.
